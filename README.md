Codú is the ultimate community of web developers to learn, share, and get support for your projects, either big or small. It is the perfect place to sharpen your skills and build your portfolio.

## 🖥️ Installation

```bash
$ npm install

# development
$ npm run dev
```

After completion of above commands, now -

Navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the result.

You can start your journey by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. With Auto-update feature, pages updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
