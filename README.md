## üñ•Ô∏è Installation

1. Fork the project
2. Clone with `git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/codu.git`.
3. Navigate to the project directory `cd codu`.
4. Install dependencies with:

```bash
npm install
```

- If you have any issues installing dependencies, check your node version against that defined in the `.nvmrc`. If you're using `nvm`, you can run `nvm use` before installing dependencies.

5. Create a `.env` file and add the following variables. You can copy the contents of `.env.example` with `cat .env.example > .env`.

```
# This default value is if you run our local docker-compose.yml file to create the database.
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:secret@127.0.0.1:5432/postgres
# Setup your GitHub ID & Secret on GitHub: https://developer.github.com/apps/building-oauth-apps/authorizing-oauth-apps
# For development, make sure you set up this with a Homepage URL of http://localhost:3000/ and an Authorization callback URL of http://localhost:3000/api/auth
GITHUB_ID=YOUR_GITHUB_APP_ID
GITHUB_SECRET=YOUR_GITHUB_APP_SECRET
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000/api/auth
```

For a more detailed how to guide on setting them up [go to the Environment Variables section](#environment-variables).

6. [Make sure your database is running](#database_url) and setup the tables in the database with Prisma by running:

```bash
npx prisma db push
```

7. Seed the database with some mock data by running:

```bash
npx prisma db seed
```

8. Finally, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

After completion of above commands, now -

Navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the result.

You can start your journey by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. With Auto-update feature, pages updates as you edit the file.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

Learn more about API routes [here](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction).

## Environment Variables

### DATABASE_URL

The `DATABASE_URL` is a connection string to a PostgreSQL database (version 15.0).

By default, we point to a database running locally with Docker from our `docker-compose.yml` file.

To run this file, make sure you have [Docker installed](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and that Docker is running.

Run the command `docker compose up`.

Alternatively, if you have PostgreSQL running locally then you can use your local connection string or grab one from a free service like [Supabase](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/database/connecting-to-postgres#finding-your-connection-string).

### GITHUB_ID and GITHUB_SECRET

Currently, we only allow authentication via GitHub. To enable this you need to have a `GITHUB_ID` and `GITHUB_SECRET` value.

Setup your GitHub ID & Secret on GitHub:

- [https://developer.github.com/apps/building-oauth-apps/authorizing-oauth-apps](https://developer.github.com/apps/building-oauth-apps/authorizing-oauth-apps)

**Shortcut** - [Click here](https://github.com/settings/applications/new) to setup New OAuth App.

For development, make sure you setup this with a **Homepage URL** of `http://localhost:3000/` and **Authorization callback URL** of `http://localhost:3000/api/auth`.

After you click the "Register application" button you should see the `GITHUB_ID` and be able to generate a new client secret. You can see this in the screenshot below. üëá

After generating the secret, make sure you copy this value to your `.env` file as this value can not be seen again once you refresh the page. üëá

### NEXTAUTH_URL

You shouldn't need to change the default value here. This is a variable used by Next Auth as the authentication URL to your site.

```
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000/api/auth
```

For more information, you can read the documentation [here](https://next-auth.js.org/configuration/options).

Example .env file can be found [here](./sample.env). You can rename this to .env to get started
