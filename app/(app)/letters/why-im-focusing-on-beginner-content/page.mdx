# Why I'm Focusing on Beginner Content (for a few weeks)

If you are in Amsterdam this week, let me know! I'll be there for JS Nation and React Summit. It's my first time MC'ing a conference, so I'm very excited.

_If you aren't interested in my slightly long blurb about why I'm working on beginner content, you can skip to the usual links below._

Over the next few weeks (or potentially months), I'll dedicate my efforts to creating content specifically for beginners.

I write articles daily, and this new initiative is part of a broader goal to build a comprehensive draft curriculum that will form the basis of a free course on our website.

CodÃº is committed to making learning accessible and enjoyable for everyone, and this new series is a testament to that mission. Let me share why this focus on beginner content is so important and what you can expect from our upcoming materials.

### **Strong Foundations**

Foundational knowledge is the bedrock of any learning journey. Whether you're learning to code, picking up a new language, or diving into a new hobby, having a solid grasp of the basics is crucial.

It enables you to understand more complex concepts, solve problems more efficiently, and build a deeper understanding of the subject matter. Just like constructing a building, without a strong foundation, the structure will eventually falter.

This principle applies universally across disciplines and is why I'm so passionate about starting from the ground up.

With AI tools and search engines making it easy to solve problems, I want to ensure that learners remember to really understand core concepts.

### **Identifying the Need for Beginner Content**

There are some fantastic resources out there for beginners.

Some of my favorite free resources areÂ **[freeCodeCamp](https://freecodecamp.org/)**Â andÂ **[The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/)**.

**So**Â **_why_**Â **am I creating something else?**

Because we are building a platform and have experience making content, we think we can blend learning with video, interactive elements, and text that are currently only available via paid platforms. So, we are hoping to take a major step forward in the quality of the content for our learners.

This will take time, but we will start with our text-based content.

We want to not only build the largest coding community in the world but also to be a place where people can develop the skills to thrive in their tech careers.

### **Goals for the New Content Series**

The primary objective of this new content series is to provide a robust foundation for beginners. We'll cover essential topics and skills that are often overlooked or underexplained. The series will include:

- Computing fundamentals
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Step-by-step tutorials on setting up your development environment.
- Introduction to key tools and technologies.
- Simple projects to practice and apply new skills.

By laying this groundwork, we aim to prepare learners for more advanced topics and projects in the future.

**We would also love feedback**, so either on our Discord or via email, let me know what topics you hope we focus on.

### **Personal Journey and Experience**

When I first began exploring new subjects, I often found myself overwhelmed by the complexity of advanced materials.

However, by revisiting foundational concepts and building my knowledge step-by-step, I was able to achieve a much deeper understanding.

I'm a self-thought developer, so I know how easy it is to miss some of the core knowledge needed when building your skillset. I'm hoping my experience will help shape a learning journey that you both enjoy and that will stay with you for the rest of your career.

**To all the new learners out there**, I want to offer a few words of encouragement.

The beginning of any learning journey can be scary, but remember that every expert was once a beginner. Nobody was born with the ability to code. Everyone had to take their first steps at some point.

Stay motivated by setting small, achievable goals and celebrate your progress.

Be bold, ask questions, and get help when needed. At CodÃº,Â **we're here to support you every step of the way**, and our community is filled with individuals who have walked the same path and are eager to help.
