# Fundamentals are Everything

Whether we realize it or not, we all rely on fundamentals daily. Fundamentals are the basic building blocks of any activity, subject, or skill.

To be successful, it is essential to have a strong foundation in the fundamentals.

For example, in basketball, the fundamentals include shooting, dribbling, and passing.

A player who has mastered these basic skills will be more successful than one who has not.

The same is true in other areas of life. To be a good writer, for instance, one must master the fundamentals of grammar and composition.

Anyone who wants to be successful in any area must first learn and master the fundamentals. Otherwise, they will likely struggle to keep up with those who have done so.

Though it may seem tedious or boring, there is no substitute for a solid foundation in the fundamentals. They are the key to success in any endeavor.

Everyone wants advanced knowledge, but only a few want to grind out the learning of the fundamentals.

But when things go awry, the basics always bail us out.

With AI driving much of our productivity, I can see many people starting to forget the fundamentals.

**Slow down**, learn them.

It's what will make you get ahead as a developer.
