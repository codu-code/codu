# New rule: No more DM-ing

New rule: **No more DM-ing** (at work, at least).

At first glance, direct messaging (DMs) may seem like an efficient way to communicate at work. After all, it's just like texting but without the hassle of remembering someone's phone number.

When people communicate via DMs, they lose the opportunity to share a question with a broader audience (and the hope of getting a quick answer if the person they message is busy).

Now, what happens when you have to ask someone else the same question, and they need to ask someone else for information?

This is where things get a little complicated.

With a team of just 14 people, we get 91 communication lines.

If you have ever played the game "Chinese Whispers" or "Telephone," you will know that our messages with just a handful of people can become utterly divergent from our original conversation.

The solution to this is using open communication streams.

### The Benefits of Open Communication Streams

Open communication streams have several benefits over direct messaging.

**DMs are disruptive.** They can disrupt workflow by implying immediate responses, breaking concentration for both sender and receiver. Open communication streams allow for a more controlled and less disruptive information flow.

Second, open communication streams promote transparency. When everyone can see the conversation, there's more room for communication and understanding.

Finally, open communication streams encourage collaboration. By seeing how others contribute to the conversation, you can easily jump in and offer your help.

The **main reason I dislike DMs** is primarily because of the **silos of knowledge they can create**.

### How to Create Open and Effective Communication Streams

By having an open conversation on team channels such as **Slack**, **Discord**, **GitHub**, or **Microsoft Teams**, you can start creating a knowledge base that you can share with people who encounter similar problems or ask how you reached a conclusion.

These tools allow you to create different channels for different topics so you can easily find the information you need without being bombarded with notifications.

Direct messaging is not transparent and is inefficient as it can lead to bottlenecks.

We all know bottlenecks are bad, so let's eliminate this one.

## Something I've been enjoying

**[Benjamin Franklin: An American Life](https://amzn.to/3VQfmsH)**

I've been re-reading this, one of my favorite books.

"Benjamin Franklin: An American Life" by Walter Isaacson is an absolute must-read. Isaacson masterfully captures Franklin's multifaceted life, his genius as an inventor, diplomat, writer, and founding father. The narrative is engaging and brings Franklin's personality and achievements to life.

It's an inspiring tale of curiosity, resilience, and innovation. If you're into American history or love a good biography about an extraordinary individual who helped shape a nation, this book will not disappoint. It's both educational and entertaining, making it a highly recommended read.

Thanks, and stay awesome,
