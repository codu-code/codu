# The Secret to Expertise ü§´

How do you get good at coding?

How do you get good at art?

**How do you get good at anything?**

We all wish there were shortcuts to expertise,

but sadly,¬†**the magic pill to instant expertise doesn't exist**.

We must start as beginners in every new subject like everyone else and consistently practice.

Digging deep enough, you will discover that all the "geniuses" we admire are human.

They, like everyone, started with no knowledge and became experts in their fields through obsession and¬†**practice**.

A while ago I read this story from Zen Master Hakuin, which reminds us to **stop looking for shortcuts and practice like we need to**.

> It's like chopping down a huge tree of immense girth. You won't accomplish it with one swing of your axe. If you keep chopping away at it, though, and do not let up, eventually, whether it wants to or not, it will suddenly topple down. When that time comes, you could round up everyone you could find and pay them to hold the tree up, but they wouldn't be able to do it. It would still come crashing to the ground.... But if the woodcutter stopped after one or two strokes of his axe to ask the third son of Mr. Chang, "Why doesn't this tree fall?" And after three or four more strokes stopped again to ask the fourth son of Mr. Li, "Why doesn't this tree fall?" he would never succeed in felling the tree. It is no different for someone who is practicing the Way.

_I read this in Robert Greene's book, "Mastery."_

## Cod√∫ CSS Course (work in progress)

This course is taking a lot more time than planned (because of the amount of demos I have to create while explaining concepts). But I'm hoping by next week, we will have our first completed draft, which will set us up to start making the JS content.

- **[Introduction to CSS](https://www.codu.co/articles/introduction-to-css-jogc_mts)**
- **[Getting Started with CSS Selectors](https://www.codu.co/articles/getting-started-with-css-selectors-c7ji-3m)**

- **[Pseudoclasses and Pseudoelements](https://www.codu.co/articles/pseudoclasses-and-pseudoelements-ejgovp3j)**

I would appreciate the chance to review some of the content, feedback, and suggestions. I'm creating a resource that all new devs will be comfortable reading through.

## Other Articles/Resources

**[The real 10x developer makes their whole team better (2 min)](https://stackoverflow.blog/2024/06/19/the-real-10x-developer-makes-their-whole-team-better/)**

Single individuals make less of a difference to the success or failure of a technology project than you might think (and that's a good thing).

**[TypeScript 5.5 (release)](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-5-5/)**

TypeScript just bumped

**[Inline conditionals in CSS, now? (20 min)](https://lea.verou.me/blog/2024/css-conditionals-now/)**

Wait a minute... CSS introduces programming? if() in CSS that won't be in browsers for a while. What are our options in the meantime?

**[Ducky Fog - Puzzle Game (CodePen)](https://codepen.io/Pedro-Ondiviela/pen/JjqKWNp)**

I'm always amazed by JavaScript games. This one is a fantastic example. It's a 50+ level puzzle game with a rubber duck that wants to travel around the world.

## Something I've been enjoying

**[Incase Backpack](https://amzn.to/4eDN5hD)**

Somebody asked me for a backpack recommendation this week, and I just realized **I've been using the same bag for the last five years**, and it's pretty much still as good as new. It's been thrown around the place and has protected my laptops for years now.

The exact backpack I got has been "improved" over the years, but it's still known as one of the best. It's one of those things that's so good that I haven't even had to think about it since I got it.

So, if you are in the market for a reliable backpack and laptop bag, the Incase Icon is epic!

That's it for this week!

If you have any ideas or feedback, reply to this email.

Thanks, and stay awesome,

Niall
