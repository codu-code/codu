# My NYC Trip, React.js Dublin + Codú Picks Await

Last week, I was over in NYC, and it was a blast.

I was only there for three nights, and I got to:

- Meet colleagues I've never met in person
- Have a community dinner with a lot of incredible MongoDB champions (thank you Veronica)
- Met Codú members from the USA
- Attended MongoDB.local NYC
- Had the best tacos of my life...

**But one thing made it even more exciting...**

In last week's email, I shared a link to support Codú and had zero expectations, so I was excited to start seeing the first Stripe notifications when I landed.

And very special thanks for supporting us!

**If you are in Dublin this week,** we have another event in MongoDB on Wednesday.

## **Something I've been enjoying**

**[Alaska Bear Sleep Mask](https://amzn.to/3weR6Ii)**\
Good quality sleep is essential for doing your best work.

A good eye mask saves the day if you need a nap or sleep somewhere that doesn't keep out all the light at night. I was reminded of that this week while sleeping on a plane and staying in a hotel just off the bright lights of Times Square.

There are so many options out there, and I've bought more expensive ones, but nothing beats the quality and design of the Alaska Bear sleep masks. They contour your eyes to ensure no light gets in while being very gentle on your face. For under 20 bucks, it's one of my best purchases. I take mine everywhere.

If you have any ideas or feedback, reply to this email.

Thanks, and stay awesome,

Niall
