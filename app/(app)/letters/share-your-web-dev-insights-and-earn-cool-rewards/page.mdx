[Create a Custom React Hook to Detect Outside Clicks (2 min)](https://www.codu.co/articles/create-a-custom-react-hook-to-detect-outside-clicks-4g3yukhk)

Pop-up elements often require detecting clicks outside these elements to close them. Let's create a reusable hook to handle this!

[OpenAI API: Insufficient Quota Error on Paid Account with Available Balance (1 min)](https://www.codu.co/articles/openai-api-insufficient-quota-error-on-paid-account-with-available-balance-qibhmpai)

I ran into this issue after not using the API in a while. Here's a straightforward guide on how I fixed this issue, which was more of a confusing error message than an actual bug.

## Other Articles/Resources

[A Little Rant about IE Color Parsing (4 min)](https://scrappy-do.blogspot.com/2004/08/little-rant-about-microsoft-internet.html)

Did you know "chucknorris" is a valid CSS color? Well this sent me down an interesting rabbit hole, which led to this article explaining why.

[S3 Is Showing Its Age (4 min)](https://materializedview.io/p/s3-is-showing-its-age)

An interesting dive into why S3 is no longer sufficient for many users.

[The long path of JavaScript - from ES6 until today (10 min)](https://academy.binary-studio.com/blog/the-long-path-of-java-script-from-es6-until-today)

How did a language developed in just ten days by Brendan Eich achieve such widespread success?

[Next.js App Router (Guide)](https://nextjs.org/learn/dashboard-app)

I stumbled across this resource on the Next.js docs, which I have obviously missed for months. It's an in-depth and fun guide on using the App Router in your Next.js apps.

[Mana Potion (GitHub)](https://github.com/verekia/manapotion)

This is a toolkit for JavaScript game development and interactive experiences. It is not a game engine or framework but a collection of low-level utilities and helpers commonly needed when building games.

[R1 Rabbit - $30,000,000 AI Is Hiding a Scam (Video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPOHf20slZg)

This came up in our Discord yesterday, and I found it fascinating. I think this will be the first of many "AI" companies leveraging the lack of consumer/VC knowledge in the space to make money on technolgy they ultimately can't deliver.

## Events in Ireland

It's not something I usually do, but a couple of things for Web Devs if you are based in Ireland.

I'll give a talk and a workshop at [Dublin Tech Summit](https://dublintechsummit.tech/) this Thursday (30th May).

- Build Your First RAG Powered App with JavaScript

- Zero to Hero: Bootstrapping a Tech Community

Stripe announced their first Dublin Web Developer Meetup on Wednesday, 5th June. You can [RSVP](https://lu.ma/ik2b05xu?tk=6DvT9n) here for free!

## Tiny Productivity Tip

_Stay Updated._

Spend a few minutes each day reading about the latest trends and tools in web development. This will keep your skills sharp and introduce you to more efficient ways of working.

## Something I've been enjoying

[Clarkson's Farm (TV Series)](https://amzn.to/4aIEgjn)

I recently binged this show, and on paper, I would have expected to hate it. It takes us on a journey with Jeremy Clarkson from a novice to a somewhat competent farmer, which resonates with many viewers, offering a compelling narrative.

The show offers a realistic look into the complexities and challenges of modern farming, providing viewers with informative and eye-opening insights into daily farm operations. The local people mixed into the chaos adds even more depth and fun. The genuine moments of success, failure, and emotion make it one of my favorite shows in a long time.

If you have any ideas or feedback, reply to this email.

Thanks, and stay awesome,

Niall Maher
