# Exclusive MongoDB Cheat Sheet + AI & .NET Insights!

I'm a big fan of cheatsheets to reference whenever I jump from stack to stack.

**I've made a free MongoDB cheatsheet for you [here](https://www.codu.co/articles/mongodb-cheat-sheet-one1gdby).**

It's a cheat sheet of all the basics you'll need when using MongoDB.

Do you have any ideas for cheat sheets you'd like to see next?

**[Svelte Native - Svelte Mobile Development](https://svelte-native.technology/)**

"Where other JavaScript mobile development frameworks like React Native and NativeScript-Vue do the bulk of their work on the mobile device, Svelte Native shifts that work into a compile step that happens when you build your app."

## Something I've been enjoying

**[DJI Osmo Pocket 3](https://amzn.to/3THqMxZ)**

Not a book this week but a cool toy I've been playing with for a few months. It's replaced my Sony a5100, and I've been using it to record my events.

It records in 4K resolution at an impressive 120fps!!!

I grabbed the creator combo and it came with an excellent DJI mic. If you are looking for an absolute beast of a camera that you can keep in your backpack, this is the one!

I'm just amazed with how high quality this camera is and how small it is.
