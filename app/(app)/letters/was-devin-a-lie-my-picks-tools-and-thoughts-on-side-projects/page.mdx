# Was Devin a lie? ðŸ¤¯ + My picks, tools, and thoughts on side-projects.

Could you learn to swim without getting into the water?Â **Of course not!**

So avoid getting trapped in a cycle of reading articles, watching videos, and thinking you are making progress.

I'm an advocate for starting side projects. Heck, CodÃº was a side project to learn some new things.

With your day job, it's easy to become comfortable solving certain types of problems or having certain people you can go to when you get stuck.

When you try something by yourself, you get creative and learn a lot more because you have to be your own safety net.

I have a few thoughts on why side projects make you a better developer, which you can read [here](https://www.codu.co/articles/why-objects-are-my-go-to-for-handling-multiple-parameters-in-javascript-functions-wws-68kv) if you are interested.

## **Something I've been enjoying**

[**Fallout - Season 1**](https://www.primevideo.com/detail/Fallout/0HAQAA7JM43QWX0H6GUD3IOF70)

Usually, it's a book or something productive. But last night, I just finished Fallout on Amazon Prime Video. What a fantastic show! As a Halo fan, this is the sort of game adaptation fans want. I'm already excited for the next season. If you are stuck for something to watch to take time away from the keyboard, give this a go!
