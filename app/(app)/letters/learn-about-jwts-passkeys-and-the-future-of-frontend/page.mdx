## Something I've been enjoying

[**Million Dollar Weekend - By Noah Kagan**](https://amzn.to/3Vk8d5l)

Fancy yourself as an entrepreneur? Noah Kagan has several multimillion-dollar companies and a philosophy of testing (and failing fast). This book guides you through creating and validating a business over a weekend. A phenomenal read for any coder spending weeks/months on hacking solutions and then struggling to get customers.
