# Making Money with Side Projects

One of the best things about being a developer is that you have the tools to build a business with just a laptop. Side projects can be more than a way to learn new skills; they can become a source of income.

The key to turning your side project into a money-making venture is to solve a real problem for a specific audience. Start by identifying pain points in your life or industry, then build a solution addressing those needs. Remember, your first version doesn't need to be perfect. Launch early, gather feedback, and iterate.

There are plenty of revenue models for monetizing your side project. You could offer a subscription service, charge a one-time fee, use a freemium model, or even explore advertising if your project gains a large user base.

This week, Syntax had a great podcast, [Fun & Profitable Side Projects for Developers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNG_tLuj4Vg), providing an excellent overview of creating profitable side projects. Another recent read demonstrating how quickly you can get going is [Million Dollar Weekend](https://amzn.to/4dURYSS). It is all about testing your ideas fast!

I love seeing what people are building and supporting those indie builders. That's why I've started a [new monthly event](https://www.linkedin.com/events/indiehackhours7237375532399562752) for Indie Hackers in Dublin. I'll most likely spin this out into an online community!

## Something I've been enjoying

**[The Unaccountability Machine](https://amzn.to/3MEf7go)**

I just finished this one, and wow, what an eye-opener! It's got me looking at big organizations in a whole new light. Dan dives into why corporations and governments sometimes make decisions that seem completely bonkers to the rest of us.

Suppose you're like me and often find yourself scratching your head at the seemingly illogical choices made by big institutions. In that case, this book is definitely worth a read. Davies has a knack for blending cynicism with solid journalism, making for an entertaining and thought-provoking journey through the madness of modern decision-making.

It might leave you both enlightened and a little more terrified about how our world works!

**That's it for this week!**
