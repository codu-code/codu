# Free PostgreSQL Course, VSCode Profiles & Fullstack Fiesta

Welcome to Cod√∫ Weekly!

This week, I stumbled upon a game-changing feature in Visual Studio Code that I can't wait to share with you. If you're like me, juggling multiple projects or switching between different development environments, you're going to love this: VS Code Profiles!

I created different profiles streams, creating tutorials and different tech stacks. You can have different extensions, themes and settings.

Here's a quick rundown on how to use them:

1.  Access Profiles: Click on the gear icon in the lower-left corner of VS Code and select "Profiles".
2.  Create a New Profile: Choose "Create Profile" and give it a name (e.g., "Python Dev", "Web Frontend", "Data Science").
3.  Customize Your Profile: Install extensions, set up your preferred color theme, adjust settings, and configure your workspace to your liking.
4.  Switch Between Profiles: Use the gear icon or the command palette (Ctrl+Shift+P or Cmd+Shift+P) and type "Switch Profile" to quickly change your setup.
5.  Export and Share: You can even export your profiles to share with team members or use across different machines!

This feature has been a total productivity booster for me. No more toggling settings or enabling/disabling extensions when switching contexts. With profiles, I can hop from my Python data analysis environment to my JavaScript web dev setup in seconds.

## Free PostgreSQL Course

PostgreSQL is one of the most verstaile and useful databases on the market. I think it's a tool all developers should know because it can solve nearly every problem you throw at it.

I've just finished an entire series which you can read for free to learn SQL and PostgreSQL:

There are some edits I still need to make to ensure it flows well but the main content shouldn't update too much.

It contains some of my biggest articles ever so I'm pretty proud of the work.

## Something I've been enjoying

**[Just My Type (Book)](https://amzn.to/3ZTGTNV)**

If you're into fonts (or even if you're not), you've gotta check out "Just My Type" by Simon Garfield. It explores all the things about fonts I've never really thought about it.

Garfield's writing style is super engaging - he manages to make the history of fonts feel like gossip. You'll find yourself chuckling at the quirky anecdotes and going "No way!" at the drama behind some of the most famous typefaces. I know... Who would have guessed that fonts would bring drama?

If you have any ideas or feedback, reply to this email.

Thanks, and stay awesome,
