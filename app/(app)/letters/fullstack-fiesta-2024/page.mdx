# Fullstack Fiesta Announced + Weekly Picks

Yesterday, we announced **Fullstack Fiesta** for later in the month.

This aims to be Ireland's biggest web developer party.

Every so often, I like to organize social events with Codú, and this is one of the biggest ones I've organized.

On Friday, the 27th of September, get together with hundreds of Ireland's developers, from fresh-faced juniors to CTOs, all in one place.

But here's the kicker -- no boring presentations or awkward small talk.

If you are in Dublin on the 27th [here's the link](https://www.meetup.com/codu-community/events/303194835) to RSVP before all the spots are taken.

**Side note:** If you can't make it to Dublin, We are aiming to expand further outside of Dublin very soon, so if you'd like to be a Codú ambassador and host events in your city with our support, let me know.
