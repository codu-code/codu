# Free CSS Course + Other Useful Links 🔗

It took a few weeks, but finally, I've gotten my first draft of the CSS course I've been working on. You can start working through it for free today!

Since I didn't write it in an order that makes complete sense, here's the order I'd work through things:

## Something I've Been Enjoying

**[The Exquisite Machine: The New Science of the Heart](https://amzn.to/3zCJCjx)**

I recently picked up "The Exquisite Machine: The New Science of the Heart" by Sian Harding, which turned out to be fascinating. Harding, an expert in heart research, explains how our heart works and the latest scientific advancements that are helping us understand it better.

What blew my mind was learning how the heart is connected to our emotions—like how stress can cause an actual condition called broken heart syndrome. The book also dives into cutting-edge tech like gene editing and stem cells that could change how we treat heart disease.

Overall, it's a super interesting book that makes complex science easy to understand. If you're curious about how your heart works and want to know about the latest research, try this one!

That's it for this week!

Thanks, and stay awesome,
