# Live Streams, PostgreSQL & Indie Hacking

We've got a [Twitch channel](https://www.twitch.tv/codudotco). Join us on Monday mornings (or catch the replays). I'll be doing some more built-in public stuff there. If you are interested in getting notifications, [hit that follow button!](https://www.twitch.tv/codudotco)

Also, here's the progress on our PostgreSQL series, which is intended to serve as an introduction to SQL and getting up and running with PostgreSQL.

**Here's what I've got so far:**

- **[What Is a Database?](https://newsletter.codu.co/l/OKhlNrmpjTTHP763xCz1UNOw/1lTg892JQyM534e8prkRPD1A/6ZwiVXikQmDtMAMEKoMSdw)**
- **[Introduction to PostgreSQL](https://newsletter.codu.co/l/OKhlNrmpjTTHP763xCz1UNOw/l892qPVfhQNrFKDF6slZyVwQ/6ZwiVXikQmDtMAMEKoMSdw)**
- **[Setting Up PostgreSQL](https://newsletter.codu.co/l/OKhlNrmpjTTHP763xCz1UNOw/ChW575wODus914KMrGr52Q/6ZwiVXikQmDtMAMEKoMSdw)**
- **[Fundamentals of Relational Databases](https://newsletter.codu.co/l/OKhlNrmpjTTHP763xCz1UNOw/hUzoGcAinZDt747rIFQSBg/6ZwiVXikQmDtMAMEKoMSdw)**
- **[Introduction to SQL: Putting Database Concepts into Practice](https://www.codu.co/articles/introduction-to-sql-putting-database-concepts-into-practice-lsega7xx)**
- **[Simple Social Media Database: SQL Solution](https://www.codu.co/articles/simple-social-media-database-sql-solution-6rhhfoxq)**
- **[SQL Queries and Filtering Data](https://www.codu.co/articles/sql-queries-and-filtering-data-zovv6gje)**
- **[PostgreSQL Data Types](https://www.codu.co/articles/postgresql-data-types-qwgsxrdh)**
- **[Deeper Dive into Foreign Keys and JOINs in SQL](https://www.codu.co/articles/deeper-dive-into-foreign-keys-and-joins-in-sql-1jkf32py)**
- **[SQL Concepts: Subqueries, Aggregations, and CTEs](https://www.codu.co/articles/sql-concepts-subqueries-aggregations-and-ctes-v2m3z9ro)**

There's still a good chunk to go! These articles are longer than other series, so bear with me as I may produce fewer articles (but more in-depth content).

## For Indie Hackers in Dublin, Ireland

_Sat, Sep 21, 2024, 10:00 AM - 2:00 PM (Irish time)_

_61 Thomas Street, Dublin, County Dublin, IE, D08 W250_

This weekend, I'm hosting an event for coders who want to launch a side project!

This new monthly event allows us to work together and learn from each other.

Join fellow indie hackers for a dedicated day of side-project development. Get the space, time, and community support to turn your weekend coding sessions into launchable products.

We are hoping you get:

- Focused coding time
- Socializing
- Support each other

We are trying to create a supportive environment for aspiring coding entrepreneurs.

## Articles/Resources

**[Why GitHub Actually Won (20 min)](https://blog.gitbutler.com/why-github-actually-won/)**

How GitHub _actually_ became the dominant force it is today, from one of its co-founders.

**[Good software development habits (2 min)](https://zarar.dev/good-software-development-habits/)**

Zarar gives some advice on what works for him.

**[7 Must-Know Lessons To Be A Better Engineer From Top Industry Leaders (4 min)](https://read.highgrowthengineer.com/p/month-of-collabs-recap-2024)**

A CTO, Software Architect, Meta staff engineer, award-winning author, and two Amazon Principal Engineers gave insights into what it takes to be a better engineer.

**[Mermaid Charts (resource)](https://www.mermaidchart.com/)**

I didn't know I needed this: charts/graphs that can be written in text so you can save them to your repo alongside code. This is pretty handy compared to updating a .png.

**[Client vs Server Components in Next.js (4 min)](https://www.codu.co/articles/client-vs-server-components-in-next-js-nixu2jzh)**

Learn what client and server components are, their differences, and when to use each. Practical examples to help you implement each.

**[Announcing TypeScript 5.6 (release)](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-5-6/)**

A new update appeared for TS! Check out what's new.

**[Look out, kids: PHP is the new JavaScript (9 min)](https://www.mux.com/blog/php-is-the-new-javascript)**

People seem excited about PHP... Want to learn why?

## Something I've been enjoying

**[Money: A Story of Humanity](https://amzn.to/4e7ajfv)**

Another week, another random book read.

David McWilliams explores how humanity evolved and our relationship with money. McWilliams is known for being a master communicator (and something I admire about him), and this book is no different.

It's one of the most enjoyable reads I've had in a long time for something that could have been boring.

**That's it for this week!**

If you have any ideas or feedback, reply to this email.

Thanks, and stay awesome,

Niall
