Sometimes I'll add my own thoughts to the start of the email, but I'll aim to keep things short and valuable.

## Something I've been enjoying

[Book: "Clear Thinking" by Shane Parrish](https://amzn.to/3UTpIcI)

I'm a big fan of Shane's writing on [Farnam Street.](https://fs.blog/) And this book is fantastic. When things get tough, it's likely your brain kinda checks out. Shane teaches us to get better at spotting important moments and how to use our smarts instead of instincts.
