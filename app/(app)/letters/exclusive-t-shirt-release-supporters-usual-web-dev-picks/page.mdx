# ðŸ‘€ Exclusive T-shirt Release for Supporters + Our Usual Web Dev Picks!

Since our last event, I've received many messages asking, "Where can I buy the Death by JavaScript T-shirts?"

Some sad news... You can't.

But, if you "really need one," as I was told by a couple of folks after a few pints the other evening, here's what you can do. If you donate â‚¬40 or more to CodÃº to support our events and platform, I'll send you one as a gift! I've made aÂ [link here](https://buy.stripe.com/6oEaELfcv6EH4M0288)Â where you can donate and support all the work in CodÃº.

\*I designed it myself on Procreate after being inspired byÂ [this site](https://deathbyjavascript.com/).

In other news, I'll be in New York all this week, so if anyone is around for a coffee or a catchup, feel free to reach out!

## Cool tools

You might be able to tell I'm working on a React Native project this week with some of the tools I've found.

**[React Native 0.74](https://reactnative.dev/blog/2024/04/22/release-0.74)**

This release adds Yoga 3.0, Bridgeless by default under the New Architecture, batched onLayout updates (New Architecture), and Yarn 3 as the default package manager for new projects.

## Something I've been enjoying

**[Alchemy: The Surprising Power of Ideas That Don't Make Sense](https://amzn.to/3JEKMwF)**

Another book this week.

Rory Sutherland is an advertising legend whose TED Talks have been viewed nearly seven million times.

In this first book, he blends cutting-edge behavioral science, stories, and branding magic to turn us all into idea alchemists (or people who think about problems differently).

This has been on my wishlist for a long time, and I just completed it. I can now see why it's been repeatedly recommended to me.

If you have any ideas or feedback, reply to this email.

Thanks, and stay awesome,

Niall
