# Hacktoberfest Starts TodayÂ + Your Weekly Picks

It's that time of year again - [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.com/) is here! ðŸŽƒ

We've got you covered if you're itching to contribute to open source to complete the challenge. CodÃº has a bunch of issues up for grabs on our GitHub repo. Whether you're a seasoned dev or just dipping your toes into the open source waters, there's something for everyone.

[JP](https://www.linkedin.com/in/john-paul-larkin/) has been working hard to open good issues for every skill level.

**Need a hand?** No worries! We've set up a dedicated Discord channel to support all of you great new contributors. So come over, pick an issue, and get coding!

Check out our GitHub issues and dive in: [https://github.com/codu-code/codu/issues](https://github.com/codu-code/codu/issues)

We met a lot of eager people over the last few weeks, so we are expecting it to be our busiest one yet. If you've never contributed to Open Source and want a step-by-step guide, I wrote one. You can follow along [here](https://www.codu.co/articles/a-beginner-s-guide-to-your-first-open-source-contribution-using-this-repository-bvdmwtsa) to get a real first contribution merged.

I'm not sure I'll have as much time for writing this month with all the chaos that it brings. So bear with me if you are expecting the usual daily article.

## Something I've been enjoying

**[Vacuum Food Sealer](https://amzn.to/3Y6TmMR)**

This is a game changer for anyone who likes to prepare meals in bulk. If you vacuum seal your food you can freeze it for up to 2 years without freezer burn! So, for me, who just started a new diet in the last few weeks, it's pretty handy having the healthy stuff ready to go (for when I'm feeling too lazy to cook).
