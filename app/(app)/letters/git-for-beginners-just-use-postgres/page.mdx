## Something I've been enjoying

**[Same as Ever: Timeless Lessons on Risk, Opportunity and Living a Good](https://amzn.to/46UV9Yb)**

This book flips the script on how we view progress, zeroing in on the timeless patterns of human behavior that shape our world. It's packed with eye-opening insights about why people do what they do, from Warren Buffett's candy bar wisdom to the craving for certainty in an uncertain world.
A very interesting way to build a mental model of what doesn't change in the world.

Thanks, and stay awesome,

Niall
