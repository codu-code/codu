# Spend an Hour Learning Something New Every Day

Some of the most successful people in business have made a habit of dedicating at least one hour of their day to learning.

When I started this habit years ago, it was to imitate the people I admired in the business world.

For example, Bill Gates said he spends an hour reading every day. Warren Buffett spends five to six hours reading newspapers and annual reports. And Elon Musk reportedly used to read up to ten hours a day.

_So what are they reading?_

Anything and everything they can get their hands on.

They're reading books about history and science and economics. They're reading articles about the latest breakthroughs in technology and medicine.

They're reading novels, biographies, and anything else that might pique their interest. And by doing so, they're giving themselves a leg up on the competition.

Because the more you know, the better equipped you are to make informed decisions, solve problems, and develop innovative solutions.

Learning something new daily makes you brighter, sharper, and more prepared to take on whatever challenges come your way.

### **So, how can you start spending an hour every day learning something new?**

Everyone I suggest this to usually has the same answer, and I will interject now - you do have the time!

Set aside a time each day just for learning.

This is even more important when you feel overwhelmed and think again, "I just don't have the time today."

Those are the days when taking a step back and focusing on something different has usually resulted in immediate breakthroughs compared to those when I suffered relentlessly.

Start with Monday - Friday if you enjoy doing nothing on your weekends.

Whether first thing in the morning or last thing at night, pick a time that works for you and stick to it.

Then, find something interesting to read (I recommend starting with something you enjoy rather than something you think you should be reading) and get started!

Learning doesn't have to be sitting at home with your head in a book.

### **Look for opportunities to learn something new in your everyday life.**

We often have opportunities to learn right before us, but we don't even realize it.

For example, if you're talking to a friend about a topic you're unfamiliar with, take a few minutes afterward to look it up online or in a book to be better informed the next time the subject comes up.

Make a point of attending events and meetings that will teach you something new. There are always conferences, workshops, lunges, etc., happening around us - we just have to try to attend them. Often, these events are free or low-cost, so there's no excuse not to go.

**_Bonus tip:_** _If no events happen that meet your interests, start planning on your own! Coordinating an event is a great way to learn more about the ins and outs of event planning and get exposure for your brand or company._

You can take an online course or sign up for newsletters from experts in your field (or fields you want to explore).

Technology has made it easier than ever before to have access to high-quality information and education without even leaving our homes or offices. So please take advantage of it!

Learning something new every day isn't just good for your career and your soul.

And luckily, there are endless opportunities for us to do just that.

So what are you waiting for? **It's time to start learning!**

## **Codú JS Course (Draft)**

## **Something I've been enjoying**

**[Designing Data-Intensive Applications](https://amzn.to/3SxYruf)**

A technical book for once!

This week, I've been diving into "Designing Data-Intensive Applications" (again) by Martin Kleppmann, and it's been a game-changer. This book is gold if you're into system design or working with large-scale data. Kleppmann breaks down complex concepts into digestible chunks, covering everything from database internals to distributed systems.

It's surprisingly readable for such a technical topic. It's a giant book, although (but I guess, what should you expect with such a massive topic?) Definitely worth checking out if you want to level up your understanding of modern data systems.

That's it for this week!

If you have any ideas or feedback, reply to this email.

Thanks, and stay awesome,
