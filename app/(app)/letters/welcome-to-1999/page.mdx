# Welcome to 1999

This week, we're diving into a blast from the past with a modern twist. Remember the good ol' days of the web, when RSS feeds were all the rage? Maybe you're young enough to have used one... Well, guess what? They're still alive and kicking, especially in the tech world!

**Cod√∫ now has an RSS feed!** üéâ Whether you're someone who swears by your RSS reader or you're just curious about what the fuss is all about, we've got you covered. By adding an RSS feed, we can now distribute our blog posts to those tech sites that still rely on RSS to keep their content fresh and up-to-date.

Thanks to Next.js and a library called [rss](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rss), it took less than 50 lines of code.

Are you curious to see how we did it? Check out the code here: [RSS Feed Code](https://github.com/codu-code/codu/blob/develop/app/feed.xml/route.ts). It's a nice little addition that bridges the gap between the past and the present, ensuring our content reaches every corner of the web.

**Image uploads:** We also added an image upload service to Cod√∫, so you can now add images to your articles without needing external links.
