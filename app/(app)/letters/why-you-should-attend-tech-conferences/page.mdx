# Why You Should Attend Tech Conferences + Other Stuff

This week, I MC'd [JSNation](https://jsnation.com/) and attended [React Summit](https://reactsummit.com/).

I'm exhausted! But it was awesome.

Here's a picture of me on stage with the other amazing MCs:

It was absolutely fantastic having fun with Phil Nash, Bruce Lawson, and Floor Drees on stage, and I'm hoping I get invited back.

If you haven't gone to a tech conference like one of these, here's why you should go:

### Meet New People

At tech conferences, you can meet many cool people who love tech like you. You can chat with experts, make new friends, and find people who share your interests. This week, I got to chat with a lot of folks I admire in the industry, and getting the chance to make relationships with those people is mind-blowing.

### Face-to-Face Talks

Talking in person is way better than online. You can have real conversations, ask questions, and get instant answers. Plus, it's easier to understand people when you see their faces and hear their voices.

### Hands-On Learning

Many conferences have workshops where you can try out new tech and tools. It's fun and a great way to learn new skills.

### Inspiration

Listening to talks and seeing what others are working on can give you new ideas. It can inspire you to start your own projects or try something new.

So, if you love tech and want to meet others who do, too, go to a tech conference!

It's a fun way to learn, connect, and get inspired.

## Something I've Been Enjoying

#### [Poor Charlie's Almanack](https://buy.stripe.com/4gw7ut4VjaK0aFG9AA)

[Stripe Press](https://press.stripe.com/) has some amazing books!

I've wanted to read this for a long time, and thankfully, the new Stripe reprint made it possible.

_Poor Charlie's Almanack_ draws on his encyclopedic knowledge of business, finance, history, philosophy, physics, and ethics to introduce the mental models' latticework, which underpins his rational and rigorous approach to life, learning, and decision-making. If you are into your mental models or better decision-making, this book is a must-read because it has lessons from the master.

That's it for this week!

If you have any ideas or feedback, reply to this email.

Thanks, and stay awesome,

Niall
