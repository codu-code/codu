# üëÄ 10+ JavaScript Features Coming Your Way + Node.js Course Launch

This week, I'm going to start with a developer tip! ‚úåÔ∏è

Boost your productivity by creating custom [Git aliases](https://git-scm.com/book/ms/v2/Git-Basics-Git-Aliases) for frequently used commands. For example, you can set up 'git st' as an alias for 'git status' by running:

```

git config --global alias.st status

```

This simple trick can save you countless keystrokes and streamline your workflow. Experiment with aliases for your most-used Git commands to find what works best.

For developers seeking inspiration for building beyond code, "Build" offers a fantastic look at the creative process. Written by Tony Fadell, co-creator of the iPod and founder of Nest, this book provides valuable insights into product development, innovation, and entrepreneurship. Fadell's unorthodox approach challenges conventional wisdom, encouraging developers to think beyond technical skills and embrace a holistic view of building products that truly matter.

## üõ†Ô∏è Something Cool

**[Cursor (The AI Code Editor)](https://www.cursor.com/)**

Over the past two weeks, I've extensively tested Cursor and found it to be a better tool for solving coding problems than Claude, ChatGPT, or GitHub Copilot. Cursor's key advantage lies in its ability to access and understand the context of your entire project and its files. This contextual awareness enables Cursor to generate more relevant and practical code solutions more consistently than other AI coding assistants I've used.
