# ü§ñ Developer Productivity Boost: Testing, Tools & Tips

Here's a testing tip that's been a game-changer for my workflow: [Playwright's test generator](https://playwright.dev/docs/codegen-intro#running-codegen).

Instead of writing UI tests manually, just run:

```
npx playwright codegen <your-url>
```

Then interact with your site naturally - click buttons, fill forms, whatever you need to test. The generator creates locators automatically (prioritizing roles, text, and test IDs), and you can even record assertions by using the toolbar to verify visibility, text, or values. Between this and AI tools at our fingertips, there are no excuses for getting good e2e tests in our code.

## üìñ Book of the Week

**[The Site Reliability Workbook: Practical Ways to Implement SRE ](https://amzn.to/3NAxhA0)**

This is a must-read for anyone interested in modern infrastructure and reliability. What sets this book apart is its intensely practical approach - it's not just theory, but actual, battle-tested methods from Google's SRE teams. While its companion book (Site Reliability Engineering) explained the 'why' of SRE, this workbook tackles the 'how' with real-world examples and hands-on practices.

## üõ†Ô∏è Something Cool

**[aider](https://aider.chat/)**

I had a call with an old friend yesterday and he showed me this one. I've just started using it so I'll write up a more detailed review in a few weeks.

"Aider lets you pair program with LLMs, to edit code in your local git repository."

It's another AI coding assistant but this one works from your terminal. What blew me away was how it automatically creates meaningful git commits for AI-suggested changes, making it feel like a natural part of your development workflow. The fact that it makes commits makes it feel like you are working with another person on your code which to me feels like a much more natural process.
