## Something I've been enjoying

**[Dear Dublin by Rudi O'Reilly Meehan](https://www.deardublin.com/)**\
Rudi has previously spoken at a Codú event, and his work blends art and science.

"Dear Dublin" begins with an empty tabletop and only comes to life when you scroll.

Postcards stack on the table as you scroll through, building a picture around how Dubliners are experiencing tourism. Each postcard combines data visualizations and text, including quotes and stories from Dubliners.

Great work, Rudi!

Thanks, and stay awesome,
