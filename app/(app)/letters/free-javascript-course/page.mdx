## Something I've been enjoying

**[How Big Things Get Done](https://amzn.to/4ckseh4)**

I've been digging into this book lately (again), and it's really eye-opening.

Bent Flyvbjerg and Dan Gardner explain why big projects often fail and how to get them done right. Their book is packed with real-world examples and practical tips that will make you rethink how you tackle any big goal.

Whether you're planning a massive project or just trying to finish that home renovation, this book has some seriously useful insights. It's a quick, engaging read that might save you a ton of headaches (and money).

That's it for this week!

If you have any ideas or feedback, reply to this email.

Thanks, and stay awesome,

Niall
