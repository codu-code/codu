# ðŸ‘‰ How to Get Free Mentorship + Top Picks!

**"Where do I find a mentor?"**

_Well, right here!_

In case you didn't know, we offer free career mentoring in our Discord every Monday - what I like to call ourÂ *Monday Mentor*.

We usually do this in the mornings, but starting next week, we will try it from 16:00 (IST).

If you are new or last attended a while ago, this slot aims to make attending easier. Our usual 10:30 slot will be a coffee session for folks used to kicking off the day and being social.

Folks who attend can book free private sessions, too (in case there are any issues you want to avoid discussing in a group setting).

You'll get a free invite to Discord when youÂ [sign-upÂ on CodÃº](https://www.codu.co/).

## Tiny Productivity Tip

Do one thing at a time.

Define a specific, achievable goal for each work session. My usual rule is if you can't fit your task on a sticky note, you need to break it down more.

## Something I've been enjoying

**[The Great Mental Models, Volume 1: General Thinking Concepts](https://amzn.to/3QR1rky)**

"Great thinkers such as Charlie Munger and Warren Buffett have credited their success to mental models-representations of how something works that can scale onto other fields."

This is one of those books I constantly go back to.

I'm aÂ hugeÂ fan of "mental models" and tools to help me think clearly.

The chapters are short, concise details on a mental model that you can apply to nearly anything to become a better thinker.

I just noticedÂ when looking for the title on Amazon that it's now available to preorder as they are re-releasing it.Â It's worth the wait!

Thanks, and stay awesome,

Niall
